## What is an Embedded System ?

* **Embedded :** *Fixed firmly or implanted.*
* **System :** *A set of things working togather.*

> **Definition :** *A small Computer that is slotted to under take a dedicated task.*
* **Small :** *Low Computation, Smaller Memory, Small size, Low Power Consumption etc.*
* **Computer :** *Revolves arround a Processor/Controller arichitecture.*
* **Dedicated Task :** *Embedded Systems are known to perform dedicated task or fullfill the specific requirement.*
* Examples : 
    * Washing Machine, Refrigerators
    * Mobile Phones, Routers
    * Smart Meters, Smart Gadgets
    * Smart Living Spaces

**1. Input Devices :** *Sensors, Human Interface Devices.*

**2. Controllers :** *Brain of your Embedded System i.e. Microcontroller has logic or program that do job which we require it to do.*

**3. Output Devices :** *Motor, Display, Some Actuators or Relays used to control or turn ON or turn OFF the other equipments.*

**4. Communication & Network :** *This has networking protocal and standard that allow you to communicate with one point to other point.*

**5. Host :** *Host may be your PC which is connected to that spacific device and it allow you to debug and also allow you to send some data to the device and get some data from the device.*

**6. Power Supply :** *All of these will not work unless we have power supply.*

*Power supply requirement varies according to followings :*
* Indoor Application
* Out door Application

**6. Electronic Glue :** *This is a series of components that you putup arround all these blocks & build them in such a way that there is a form of Communication between each of them so that system works togather as an entire Embedded System.*

> **Embedded Devies :** *Some of Popularly avilable devies*
